This is a Play framework web application for playing a video using DASH from Wowza Streaming Engine service 
===========================================================================================================

Server:
==========================

We hosted a video server using Wowza Streaming Engine. We followed the steps mentioned in their user manual found online: http://goo.gl/1Wf5NS

We then created a SMIL file in the VOD application on Wowza, with 2 different video files (.mp4) of the same video, each having a different bitrate quality, 720p and 360p. We had to name them Test_360.mp4 and Test_720.mp4. Also, for each of the files we had to enter some properties as follows:

360p file:

Tag Type
video
Source (src)
Test_360.mp4
System Language
eng
Video Bitrate
10000  bps
Video Width
480
Video Height
360
Audio Bitrate
3000  bps

720p file:
Tag Type
video
Source (src)
Test_720.mp4
System Language
eng
Video Bitrate
24000000  bps
Video Width
1280
Video Height
720
Audio Bitrate
1000000  bps

Then, we obtained the url to the video file from the Test Players section of Wowza: http://[our ip address]:1935/vod/smil:Test.smil/manifest.mpd

Client:
==========================
We created a simple Play Framework application, with the above url as the url for the dash player in the index.html

<video data-dashjs-player autoplay src="http://[our ip address]:1935/vod/smil:Test.smil/manifest.mpd" controls></video>

We included the dash.js from https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js and included it as "dashProxyClient.js" in our project and made our changes in the file.

Run Instructions:
==========================
To run the application, in the terminal switch to the folder where the project is and then type "activator run" at the terminal (activator from play framework is needed to be installed for this to work)

This will start the server at localhost:9000, and hitting that address on the web browser will play the video.
